Search Google API through [Serpapi](https://serpapi.com/).

## This project allow the user to search the Google Image API from Serpapi and see a three column grid view of returned images.

## Features

- GetX Integrations for state managment and reactive design.
- Download images to the local device.
- Some reusable widgets to build upon for future updates.

## To Do's

- Update some animations.
- I think that due to the number of network calls for the images that causes some timeout errors. Need to investigate that.
- Fix web version.
